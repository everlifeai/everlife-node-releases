# Setup Telegram Channel

_Note:_ Setting up Telegram is optional, you can chat to your Avatar locally using the Chat GUI if you prefer. 

To chat with your bot 'on the go' (on your mobile phone for example) you
can use the excellent [Telegram](the://telegram.org) application. The
avatar has a communication channel that integrates with Telegram. The
steps for doing this are as follows:

1. Go to [Telegram](https://telegram.me/botfather) to create a bot by
   typing

            /newbot

    command to create your telegram bot.

1. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username, then generate an
   authorization token for your new bot. The token is a string along the
   lines of 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw. 
1. We now need to link this new telegram bot with your avatar. To do
   this, simply save the telegram token in `cfg.env` in your data
   directory.
